# SwiftyPSCorePlugin
The SwiftyPSCorePlugin is used, along with [SwiftyPSCore](https://github.com/NRCA/SwiftyPSCore), to interact with PowerSchool API. The plugin does a couple of things:
1. Provides the credentials needed to connect with the PowerSchool API using SwiftyPowerSchool.
2. Allows you to use core [PowerQueries](https://support.powerschool.com/developer/#/page/powerqueries). Please note that for any core PowerQueries you would like to use, you will need to update the <[access-request](https://support.powerschool.com/developer/#/page/access-request)> element accordingly.

You can use the plugin as is, or you can modify and add to it as you see fit.
