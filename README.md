# SwiftyPowerSchool-Plugin
The SwiftyPowerSchool-Plugin is used, along with [SwiftyPowerSchool](/NRCA/SwiftyPowerSchool), to interact with PowerSchool API. The plugin does a couple of things:
1. Provides the credentials needed to connect with the PowerSchool API using SwiftyPowerSchool.
2. Allows you to create custom [PowerQueries](https://support.powerschool.com/developer/#/page/powerqueries), which are SQL statements executed directly on the PowerSchool server.

You can use the plugin as is, or you can modify and add to it as you see fit.
